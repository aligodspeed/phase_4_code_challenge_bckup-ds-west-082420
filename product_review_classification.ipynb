    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "Our company wants a tool that will automatically classify product reviews as _positive_ or _negative_ reviews, based on the features of the review.  This will help our Product team to perform more sophisticated analyses in the future to help ensure customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Understanding\n",
    "We have a labeled collection of 20,000 product reviews, with an equal split of positive and negative reviews. The dataset contains the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `ProductId` Unique identifier for the product\n",
    " - `UserId` Unqiue identifier for the user\n",
    " - `ProfileName` Profile name of the user\n",
    " - `HelpfulnessNumerator` Number of users who found the review helpful\n",
    " - `HelpfulnessDenominator` Number of users who indicated whether they found the review helpful or not\n",
    " - `Time` Timestamp for the review\n",
    " - `Summary` Brief summary of the review\n",
    " - `Text` Text of the review\n",
    " - `PositiveReview` 1 if this was labeled as a positive review, 0 if it was labeled as a negative review"

    "### 1) Data Preparation\n",
    "A train-test split has already been performed.\n",
    "Additionally, there is already a pipeline in place that drops some columns and converts all text columns into a numeric format for modeling.\n",
    "**Your only additional data preparation task is feature scaling.**  Tree-based models like Random Forest Classifiers do not require scaling, but TensorFlow neural networks do.\n",
    "There are two main strategies you can take for this task:\n",
    "#### Scaling within the existing pipeline\n",
    "If you are comfortable with pipelines, this is the more polished/professional route.\n",
    "1. Make a new pipeline, with a `StandardScaler` as the final step.  You can nest the steps of the previous pipeline inside of this new pipeline\n",
    "2. Generate a new `X_train_transformed_scaled` by calling `.fit_transform` on the new pipeline\n",
    "3. Generate a new `X_test_transformed_scaled` by calling `.transform` on the new pipeline\n",
    "#### Scaling after the pipeline has finished\n",
    "This is a better strategy if you are not as comfortable with pipelines.\n",
    "1. Instantiate a `StandardScaler` object\n",
    "2. Generate a new `X_train_transformed_scaled` by calling `.fit_transform` on the scaler object, after you have called `.fit_transform` on the pipeline\n",
    "3. Generate a new `X_test_transformed_scaled` by calling `.transform` on the scaler object, after you have called `.transform` on the pipeline\n",
    "If you are getting stuck at this step, skip it.  The model will still be able to fit, although the performance will be worse.  Keep in mind whether or not you scaled the data in your final analysis.\n",
    "### 2) Modeling\n",
    "Build a neural network classifier.  Specifically, use the `keras` submodule of the `tensorflow` library to build a multi-layer perceptron model with the `Sequential` interface.\n",
    "See the [`tf.keras` documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/overview) for an overview on the use of `Sequential` models. See the [Keras layers documentation](https://keras.io/layers/core/) for descriptions of the `Dense` layer options.  \n",
    "1. Instantiate a `Sequential` model\n",
    "2. Add an input `Dense` layer.  You'll need to specify a `input_shape` = (11275,) because this is the number of features of the transformed dataset.\n",
    "3. Add 2 `Dense` hidden layers.  They can have any number of units, but keep in mind that more units will require more processing power.  We recommend an initial `units` of 64 for processing power reasons.\n",
    "4. Add a final `Dense` output layer.  This layer must have exactly 1 unit because we are doing a binary prediction task.\n",
    "5. Compile the `Sequential` model\n",
    "6. Fit the `Sequential` model on the preprocessed training data (`X_train_transformed_scaled`) with a b`batch_size` of 50 and `epochs` of 5 for processing power reasons.\n",
    "### 3) Model Tuning + Feature Engineering\n",
    "If you are running out of time, skip this step.\n",
    "Tune the neural network model to improve performance.  This could include steps such as increasing the units, changing the activation functions, or adding regularization.\n",
    "We recommend using using a `validation_split` of 0.1 to understand model performance without utilizing the test holdout set.\n",
    "You can also return to the preprocessing phase, and add additional features to the model.\n",
    "### 4) Model Evaluation\n",
    "Choose a final `Sequential` model, add layers, and compile.  Fit the model on the preprocessed training data (`X_train_transformed_scaled`, `y_train`) and evaluate on the preprocessed testing data (`X_test_transformed_scaled`, `y_test`) using `accuracy_score`.\n",
    "### 5) Technical Communication\n",
    "Write a paragraph explaining whether Northwind Trading Company should switch to using your new neural network model, or continue to use the Random Forest Classifier.  Beyond a simple comparison of performance, try to take into consideration additional considerations such as:\n",
    " - Computational complexity/resource use\n",
    " - Anticipated performance on future datasets (how might the data change over time?)\n",
    " - Types of mistakes made by the two kinds of models\n",
    "You can make guesses or inferences about these considerations.\n",
    "**Include at least one visualization** comparing the two types of models.  Possible points of comparison could include ROC curves, colorized confusion matrices, or time needed to train."
